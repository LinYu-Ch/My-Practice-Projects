# Streamelements Gacha
This project aims to prototype and develop a system that displays and records randomized events, based on a defined set of possible outcomes. The system is inspired by "gacha" mechanics, commonly found in games and interactive streams.

## Features

- **Randomized Event Generation:** Draws events from a configurable pool of possible outcomes.
- **Event Display:** Shows the result of each random draw in a user-friendly format.
- **Event Recording:** Logs each event for tracking and analysis.
- **Modular Components:** Designed for easy extension and integration with other streamelements systems.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (if any).
3. Run the main script to start generating and recording events.

## Use Cases

- Streamer engagement tools (e.g., chat-triggered gacha draws)

## Roadmap

- Prototyping data flow and management systems
- Integration with StreamElements API
- Implementation into StreamElements online sandbox
- Customizable event pools and probabilities
- Web-based UI for live interaction
